This repository provides R code to create a local version of the University of Florida statistics job site: http://www.stat.ufl.edu/jobs/

Currently the site itself is not searchable. The R code UFLJobsSearch.R pulls all posted jobs and their urls. May be somewhat slow due to the bandwidth available on the site.

### The R Shiny app version of this is available here: https://geekman1.shinyapps.io/UFLJobs/
